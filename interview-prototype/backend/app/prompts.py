# --- Initial Questions Generation ---
INITIAL_QUESTIONS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a hiring manager preparing for a first-round screening interview.
Generate exactly {num_questions} insightful and tailored interview questions based on the candidate's resume and the provided job description.
Your questions should aim to:
  1. Assess the candidate's fit for the role described in the job description (if provided).
  2. Probe deeper into specific skills, experiences, or projects mentioned in the resume that seem relevant.
  3. Identify potential gaps or areas needing clarification.
Avoid generic questions. Phrase them clearly as conversation starters.
Format the output ONLY as a numbered list, with each question on a new line (e.g., '1. Question text'). Do not include any introductory or concluding text, just the numbered questions. Make each question as short as possible.
